 This is a fork of Luwx's [LightlyShaders](https://github.com/Luwx/LightlyShaders), which in turn is a fork of [ShapeCorners](https://sourceforge.net/projects/shapecorners/). 

 This fork fixes the infamous [bug](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395725) with blurred corners, as well as the [bug](https://github.com/matinlotfali/KDE-Rounded-Corners/issues/2) with cut out shadows, though in a somehow hacky way. 
 
 Also, it adds the following functionality:
 - an additional outer dark outline; 
 - an option to make dark outline totally black (good with dark themes);
 - an option to disable plugin for maximized windows;
 - an option to use squircled corners instead of rounded (based on code from ZacharyTalis's [ShapeCorners fork](https://github.com/ZacharyTalis/ShapeCorners));
 - support for scaling on Wayland (though, fractional scaling still may cause artifacts; only integer scaling works without issues for now);
 - support for multimonitor setups on Wayland including setups with different scaling factor per monitor (still needs some work, see [issue #51](https://github.com/a-parhom/LightlyShaders/issues/51)).


# Warnings:

## 1. This effect is basically a hack!
Due to the changes introduced in Plasma 5.23 there is no way to draw original shadows under rounded corners any more. 

In order to work around that, this fork uses a hack that tries to restore the shadow in the cut out regions based on the data from the closest regions with shadows. 

Because of this it may work differently with different themes, corner radiuses or shadow settings. **Your mileage may vary.**

## 2. This effect can be resource-hungry!
Thanks to recent changes the performance of this plugin has improved. But depending on your hardware, you still can have performance hit. Or you can try and test the new upcoming version wich has almost no performance impact.


# Try version 2.0
If you use Plasma 5.25 and your GPU supports OpenGL 3.1, you should use the version 2.0 from the [master branch](https://github.com/a-parhom/LightlyShaders).

It is fully compatible with stock Plasma effects, including Wobbly windows, and has no performance impact.

You will have to use it together with window decorations that deal with "korner bug", I recommend **SierraBreezeEnhanced**.

## Note
After some updates of Plasma this plugin may need to be recompiled in order to work with changes introduced to KWin.
